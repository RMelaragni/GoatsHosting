        <h3><b>Frequently Asked Questions and Rules</b></h3>


			<h3>Accounts</h3>			
				<h4><b>How long does it take to activate accounts after paying?</b><br>
					Generally I will get it activated within the hour(if not minutes) of purchase. However, I'm human and sometimes don't see things right away. Feel free to send me a reminder in discord. <br><br>
				<h4><b>Can I invite someone to join?</b><br>
					Heck yes! After they sign up you may want to give me a heads up in discord so I can activate thier account ASAP<br><br>
				<h4><b>How do I unsubscribe?</b><br>
					On the Subscribe page in the lower right in corner there is an "Unsubscribe" button.<br><br>
				<h4><b>After I unsubscribe, when will I lose access?</b><br>
					Immediately. So time your deavtivation wisely. I'm not trying punish anyone for canceling it's just a logistical nightmare to track remaining time.

			<h3>Account sharing and concurrent steams</h3>		
				<h4><b>Can I share my account?</b><br>
					No. However, you may have the account on multiple of your own devices.<br>
				<b>How many concurrent steams can I have?</b><br>
					3 from the same IP address. This generally means anyone in your home on your network can watch.<br>
					1 from a mobile device off your home network. Example: When streaming from a cell phone while out of your home. <br><br>
				<b>Can you tell if I share my acount?</b><br>
					Easily. We don't have a person actively monitoring you. However, we do have robust security software.<br><br>
				<h4><b>What happens if I share my account?</b><br>
					You will be banned from Goats Media.

			<h3>Requests</h3>	
				<h4><b>How can I request a movie or tv show?</b><br>
					Requests can be made on the right side of the website in the tab labeled "Request".<br><br>
				<h4><b>How many requests can I make?</b><br>
					5 Movie a week. 10 TV episodes a week. <br><br>
				<h4><b>My request didn't show up</b><br>	
					This happens sometimes for a few reaons. <br>
					1. The request is too obscure and noone's hosting it. <br>
					2. The content hasnt been released yet or is too new. <br>
					3. The download is stalled. If this is the case, you should see it on the bottom of the website stuck at a %. You can message us on Discord to try to find another source. This happens automaticly after 24 hours of being stalled. I know you may want to watch it now, So I can manually check(If I'm available)
